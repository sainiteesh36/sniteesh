# About Me

Hi, I’m Sai Niteesh Ganga! I graduated from **NIT Warangal in 2023** and I’m currently working at **Nutanix**.  

Most of my work (and interests) revolve around:  
- **Cloud & Infrastructure** – Kubernetes, Docker, automation, and distributed systems  
- **Databases** – Redis, Valkey, PostgreSQL, and storage internals  
- **Software Development** – Building reliable and scalable applications  
- **DevOps Practices** – CI/CD, monitoring, and performance tuning  

## Why I Write

This blog is a place where I document what I’m learning or working on. Whether it’s working with cloud infrastructure, debugging tricky issues, or diving into how systems work under the hood, writing helps me clarify my thoughts and hopefully helps others who run into similar problems.
 

## What to Expect Here

- Technical walkthroughs and tutorials  
- Notes from projects I’m working on    
- Learnings from real-world problems and experiments  

## Connect

I’m always open to discussions about tech, sharing ideas, or just geeking out over distributed systems. You can reach me through the [contact page](/contact/).
